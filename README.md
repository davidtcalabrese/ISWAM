# ISWAM
## IoT Severe Weather Alert Monitor ‚õàÔ∏è üö® üå™Ô∏è üö® üåä

ISWAM consists of two parts, a fullstack JavaScript application and The Puck‚Ñ¢, an ESP32 microcontroller which provides current weather information as well as NWS alerts via a small LCD screen and a ring of LEDs. The JavaScript application has a front end which receives a zip code from the user, sends it to a node application for processing, receives the response and displays it to the page. The node application receives the parameters from the user, and consumes various REST APIs to collect data on current weather conditions as well as any potential safety alerts. It then processes and formats the data, sending the results back to the front end as well as to The Puck which exposes its own API.   
 
### APIs used
* [National Weather Service API ](https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api)
  * alert from UGC endpoint: /alerts/active/zone/{zoneId}
  * UGC from coordinates endpoint: https://api.weather.gov/points/{lat},{long}
  * Coordinates from UGC endpoint (for testing): https://api.weather.gov/zones/forecast/{UGC}
* [Weatherbit.io API](https://www.weatherbit.io/api)
  * weather from zipcode endpoint: https://api.weatherbit.io/v2.0/current/&postal_code={zip}&country=US
* [Zippopatmus](https://www.zippopotam.us/)
  * Geographic coordinates from zipcode endpoint: http://api.zippopotam.us/us/${zip} 
  * Alert from zip codehttps://api.weatherbit.io/v2.0/alerts?country=US&postal_code={zip}
* [Google Maps Geocoding API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/start)
  * Used the reverse geocoding API for testing purposes, zip code from coordinates: https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?latlng={lat},{long}
