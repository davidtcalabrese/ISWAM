Sand Point. This system will push a front towards Kodiak Island
by early Monday morning. As is often the case with storms from
this direction, the forecast models are struggling to lock onto
the storm track. Also, due to warm sea surface temperatures
(~40F), there will be a fine line between cold temperatures and
snow versus 35F and rain. This system will also bring strong winds
across the Gulf with the potential for gusts to approximately 50
mph.

IF the temperatures can remain cold enough to keep the
precipitation as snow, the result would be moderate to heavy
snowfall rates with the potential for significant accumulation on
the order of 6 to 10 inches. The combination of winds and falling
(driving) snow could make for an extended period of reduced
visibility.

Due to the large amount of uncertainty with the exact track of the
storm, forecast confidence is low at this time. However, stay
advised of the forecast as we head through the weekend and refine
the details."
