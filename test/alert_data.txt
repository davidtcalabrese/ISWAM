over the central North Pacific with a strong potential to produce
very heavy rainfall across the main Hawaiian Islands. The rainfall
duration and intensity is likely to produce numerous flooding
impacts possibly as early as Saturday but more likely from Sunday
into early next week.

It is too soon to know exactly where the main rain bands will set
up, but the areas with the greatest current potential for flooding
include the Big Island and Maui County. Additional rain bands may
also develop and affect Oahu and Kauai County as the event
progresses into next week.

Keep up to date with the latest forecast information through the

Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks. Most likely rivers
to watch at this time include the Nooksack, Skagit, Stillaguamish,
Bogachiel, and Skokomish Rivers. Any flooding that does occur will

- Moderate to heavy rain, along with warm temperatures, breezy
winds, and high relative humidities will increase snow melt,
though there is less than normal low and mid elevation snow
available to melt. Rainfall up to 2 to 4 inches in the
mountains and 1 to 2 inches in the lowlands, combining with
snow levels above 10,000 feet, will have rivers rising in the
watch area and they could see minor flooding. With this
decently strong atmospheric river just to our north, should
it slide in a little more to the south, there would be
potential for flooding on the more northerly rivers to be
moderate severity instead of minor.

the mid teens on Monday, floating sheets of ice should be observed
passing through the area by early next week. Since the river is
currently free of ice, and this will be a relatively short duration
of very cold weather, it is not a certainty that enough ice will
form to cover the river channel in the Bismarck and Mandan area.

The past ten years have seen between 5 and 7 feet of rise in water
levels during a complete icing over of the river, often within 24
hours. The Missouri River gage at Bismarck is currently around 3.6
feet and even though a great amount of uncertainty always exists
with ice affected water levels, recent history would suggest that
even a complete icing over of the river would keep water levels

- A cold front will move over the islands from the northwest
tonight and Friday, initially bringing a relatively short
period of heavy rainfall to Kauai and Oahu. The front is
expected to stall near Maui County and the Big Island late
Friday, bringing the potential for an extended period of
heavy rainfall as a slow-moving kona low forms west of Kauai
on Saturday. As the low develops, moisture associated with
the front will spread back toward the west, bringing the
threat of heavy rainfall to all islands, with this threat
