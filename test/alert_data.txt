over the central North Pacific with a strong potential to produce
very heavy rainfall across the main Hawaiian Islands. The rainfall
duration and intensity is likely to produce numerous flooding
impacts possibly as early as Saturday but more likely from Sunday
into early next week.

It is too soon to know exactly where the main rain bands will set
up, but the areas with the greatest current potential for flooding
include the Big Island and Maui County. Additional rain bands may
also develop and affect Oahu and Kauai County as the event
progresses into next week.

Keep up to date with the latest forecast information through the

Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks. Most likely rivers
to watch at this time include the Nooksack, Skagit, Stillaguamish,
Bogachiel, and Skokomish Rivers. Any flooding that does occur will

- Moderate to heavy rain, along with warm temperatures, breezy
winds, and high relative humidities will increase snow melt,
though there is less than normal low and mid elevation snow
available to melt. Rainfall up to 2 to 4 inches in the
mountains and 1 to 2 inches in the lowlands, combining with
snow levels above 10,000 feet, will have rivers rising in the
watch area and they could see minor flooding. With this
decently strong atmospheric river just to our north, should
it slide in a little more to the south, there would be
potential for flooding on the more northerly rivers to be
moderate severity instead of minor.
