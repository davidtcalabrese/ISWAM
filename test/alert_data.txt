Sand Point. This system will push a front towards Kodiak Island
by early Monday morning. As is often the case with storms from
this direction, the forecast models are struggling to lock onto
the storm track. Also, due to warm sea surface temperatures
(~40F), there will be a fine line between cold temperatures and
snow versus 35F and rain. This system will also bring strong winds
across the Gulf with the potential for gusts to approximately 50
mph.

IF the temperatures can remain cold enough to keep the
precipitation as snow, the result would be moderate to heavy
snowfall rates with the potential for significant accumulation on
the order of 6 to 10 inches. The combination of winds and falling
(driving) snow could make for an extended period of reduced
visibility.

Due to the large amount of uncertainty with the exact track of the
storm, forecast confidence is low at this time. However, stay
advised of the forecast as we head through the weekend and refine
the details."

stalls out, expect rapid snow accumulation of several inches of

heaviest band during the overnight has been located mostly on the
extreme southwestern part of the Western Kenai Peninsula (Anchor
Point), though, this band extends eastward into Homer. Due to cold
temperatures, this snow remains very light and powdery. Gusty
west to southwest winds will cause the snow to drift and reduce
visibility, so motorists should use caution.

the bands towards Seldovia, though, there is also the risk that

Corrected to note the circulation is the subject of a TCFA.

...STRONGER WINDS AND HAZARDOUS SEAS TO CONTINUE THROUGH TUESDAY
AFTERNOON DUE TO PASSING TROPICAL DISTURBANCE...

A circulation, centered about 205 miles south-southeast of Guam near
11N146E, is moving west-northwest at about 16 mph and continues to
slowly develop. This circulation is now the subject of a Tropical
Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) issued by the Joint Typhoon Warning
Center (JTWC). Hazardous sea conditions, hazardous surf and a high
risk of rip currents are expected to last through Tuesday afternoon
before conditions improve as the circulation moves farther into the
Philippine Sea.

Winds: Breezy northeast winds of 15 to 25 mph tonight will increase
early Monday, becoming east to southeast at 20 to 25 mph with near
gale-force gusts of 35 mph possible near heavier showers. Winds will
gradually diminish beginning Monday evening.

Seas: Large breaking waves of 9 to 12 feet and dangerous rip currents
may last through Tuesday afternoon, as the circulation continues to
move by the Marianas. Seas and surf will diminish quickly once the
circulation has moved farther into the Philippine Sea and winds have
subsided.

Rainfall: A potential of 3 to 5 inches to fall over the Marianas
through Tuesday night, however, locally higher amounts are possible.

Inter-island travel is discouraged the next few days. Folks in the
Marianas should keep up to date with the latest statements and
advisories from the National Weather Service and your local emergency
management offices. Forecast products issued by the National Weather
Service are posted on the WFO Guam web page at www.weather.gov/gum."

* IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks. Most likely rivers
to watch at this time include the Nooksack, Skagit, Stillaguamish,
Bogachiel, and Skokomish Rivers. Any flooding that does occur will
likely be minor.

* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
- Moderate to heavy rain, along with warm temperatures, breezy
winds, and high relative humidities will increase snow melt,
though there is less than normal low and mid elevation snow
available to melt. Rainfall up to 2 to 4 inches in the
mountains and 1 to 2 inches in the lowlands, combining with
snow levels above 10,000 feet, will have rivers rising in the
watch area and they could see minor flooding. With this
decently strong atmospheric river just to our north, should
it slide in a little more to the south, there would be
potential for flooding on the more northerly rivers to be
moderate severity instead of minor.
