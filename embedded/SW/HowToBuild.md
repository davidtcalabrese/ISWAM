How to build the embedded software:


* Install Visual Studio Code

* Install Git for Windows

* From within VSC, install the Platform IO extension. It takes a while, and will require a restart of VSC.

* From the Platfrom IO Home window, select Open Project, then navigate to ISWAM/embedded/SW and choose that directory

* On left hand side of VSC, click on Platform IO (alien head). Then from Project Tasks window, select General->Build. 
This should download and build all of the pieces of the project, and you should get a "Success" in the terminal window.
